# OTI Management System - Quick Start Guide

## üìã What You Have

You now have three key documents to guide your development:

1. **OTI-Management-Requirements.md** - Complete requirements specification
2. **CURSOR-PROMPT.md** - Comprehensive prompt for Cursor AI
3. **TASKS.md** - Task tracking file using ai-dev-tasks methodology

## üöÄ Getting Started with Cursor

### Step 1: Setup Your Project

1. **Create project folder**:
   ```bash
   mkdir oti-management-system
   cd oti-management-system
   ```

2. **Copy your documents**:
   - Place all three documents in your project root
   - These will serve as reference for Cursor

3. **Initialize Git** (recommended):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with requirements and task tracking"
   ```

### Step 2: Open in Cursor

1. **Open Cursor IDE**
2. **Open your project folder**: `File > Open Folder`
3. **Open TASKS.md** in the editor (keep it visible)

### Step 3: Start Development with Cursor

#### Option A: Give Cursor the Full Context (Recommended)

In Cursor's chat panel, paste this:

```
I'm building an OTI Management System for Lake Macquarie City Council. Please read these files to understand the project:

1. Read OTI-Management-Requirements.md for complete requirements
2. Read CURSOR-PROMPT.md for technical specifications and development approach
3. Read TASKS.md for task breakdown and tracking methodology

After reading these files, let's start with TASK-001: Setup project structure and files.

Please:
1. Create the complete folder structure
2. Create all files mentioned in TASK-001
3. Update TASKS.md to mark TASK-001 as "In Progress"
4. Follow the specifications exactly as documented

When TASK-001 is complete:
- Update TASKS.md to mark it as Done
- Add completion notes
- Ask me if I'm ready to proceed to TASK-002
```

#### Option B: Step-by-Step Approach

For more control, work through tasks one at a time:

```
I'm building an OTI Management System. Please read CURSOR-PROMPT.md and TASKS.md.

Let's start with TASK-001. Please:
1. Create the folder structure as specified
2. Create index.html with the template provided
3. Create all CSS and JS files with headers
4. Download D3.js v7 and place in /lib
5. Update TASKS.md to track progress

After completing this, I'll review before moving to TASK-002.
```

### Step 4: Working Pattern for Each Task

For each task, use this pattern with Cursor:

```
Let's work on TASK-XXX: [Task Name]

Please:
1. Read the task details from TASKS.md
2. Implement according to specifications in CURSOR-PROMPT.md
3. Test as described in acceptance criteria
4. Update TASKS.md with completion notes
5. Show me what you've created

After I verify it works, we'll move to the next task.
```

## üìù Task Tracking Workflow

### Before Starting a Task

1. Open TASKS.md
2. Find the next task
3. Update status to "In Progress"
4. Add start timestamp to development log

### While Working on a Task

1. Follow implementation notes
2. Test as you go
3. Document any decisions or issues
4. If you discover new tasks, add them to TASKS.md

### After Completing a Task

1. Verify all acceptance criteria met
2. Complete testing steps
3. Update task status to "Done"
4. Fill in completion notes (actual effort, issues, lessons)
5. Update development log
6. Commit code with task reference:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "TASK-XXX: [Task description] - Complete"
   ```

## üîÑ Using Cursor Effectively

### Best Practices

1. **Give Context**: Always reference the relevant documents
   ```
   "According to CURSOR-PROMPT.md, we need to..."
   "The requirements in OTI-Management-Requirements.md specify..."
   ```

2. **Be Specific**: Reference exact task numbers
   ```
   "Let's work on TASK-007 from TASKS.md"
   ```

3. **Request Updates**: Ask Cursor to update task tracking
   ```
   "Please update TASKS.md to mark TASK-001 as Done and add completion notes"
   ```

4. **Test Incrementally**: Test after each task
   ```
   "Before we move to TASK-002, let's test TASK-001 thoroughly"
   ```

5. **Document Decisions**: Keep track of changes
   ```
   "Add a note to TASKS.md under 'Notes & Decisions' about this approach"
   ```

### Example Cursor Conversation Flow

```
You: "Read CURSOR-PROMPT.md and TASKS.md. Let's start TASK-001."

Cursor: [Creates folder structure and files]

You: "Great! Let's test this. Open index.html in browser and verify no errors."

Cursor: [Provides testing instructions]

You: "Perfect! Update TASKS.md to mark TASK-001 as Done with these completion notes:
- Completed in 45 minutes
- No issues encountered
- D3.js v7.9.0 downloaded from cdn
Now let's proceed to TASK-002."

Cursor: [Updates TASKS.md and begins TASK-002]
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Cursor seems confused:

1. **Reset context**:
   ```
   "Please re-read CURSOR-PROMPT.md and TASKS.md to refresh context"
   ```

2. **Be more specific**:
   ```
   "According to TASK-XXX in TASKS.md, the acceptance criteria are..."
   ```

3. **Break it down**:
   ```
   "Let's break TASK-007 into smaller steps:
   Step 1: Create the HTML structure
   Step 2: Add filtering logic
   ..."
   ```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Cursor creates React code despite restrictions
- **Solution**: Remind it: "Remember, no React. Use vanilla JavaScript as specified in CURSOR-PROMPT.md"

**Issue**: Styles don't match brand
- **Solution**: "Please use the exact colors and fonts from the design tokens in CURSOR-PROMPT.md"

**Issue**: Code is too complex
- **Solution**: "Keep it simple. This is a prototype, not production. Follow the KISS principle."

**Issue**: Not updating TASKS.md
- **Solution**: "Please update TASKS.md after completing each task as specified in the ai-dev-tasks methodology"
