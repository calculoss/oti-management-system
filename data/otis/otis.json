Staff have expressed frustration because they are unable to track the status of their requests, which leads to uncertainty and repeated inquiries. Additionally, there is no system in place to provide automatic updates to staff about the progress of their requests. This lack of feedback results in multiple customers often reporting the same issue, causing duplicated efforts for the Facilities Management Team.  Moreover, we do not have a mechanism to track the types of requests, which hinders our ability to gain insights for asset management and identify trends. This absence of data tracking keeps our approach reactive rather than proactive. The lack of a streamlined process leads to inefficiencies, increased costs, and the risk of requests being lost, missed, or not followed up on.",

This results in fragmentation of information, which: - reduces Council’s ability to easily recognise key insights, such as emerging Council-wide issues - increases the risk of duplication of effort through staff having to access various information sources to obtain information - slows the ability of senior staff to see and respond to risks across multiple levels, leading to delayed decision-making on key issues - leads to potential ‘silo-ing’ of information, meaning information is not available across business units to inform decision-making - for example, lower level risks being reported via email and not captured in appropriate enterprise systems, and/or issues that relate to significant risks, such as legislative compliance, not being captured and properly escalated  Council has a range of other systems, which are relevant to risk management but not integrated to support risk-informed decision-making – for example: - Sycle/CAMMs contains information about actions for business planning – which should be informed by the risk management framework but has no direct link with top-level risk management reporting or department risk registers (undertaken manually in word and saved in TRIM). - Done Safe as an incident management system contains information about non-conformance hazards (for example, non-compliance with legislation), with information included inconsistently - Local Government Legal provides a delegations and legislative compliance register, containing information about key legislative requirements applicable to local government, but does not integrate with other Council systems to manage compliance risks   Governance Risk and Compliance is a concept referring to an integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organisation to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty and act with integrity. In Council, this could capture a range of ‘second line’ functions undertaken by Integrity and Risk, designed to provide assurance for and power an ethical, risk informed and resilient organisation, including risk and compliance management.",

    "description": "The current ESRI-based solution was implemented prior to the 2019 restructure of the Horticulture and Mowing teams. While it has supported the teams in mapping individual jobs and tracking service frequency, its functionality has become increasingly limited. The system uses color-coded mapping to visually represent service delivery performance, distinguishing between on-time and overdue tasks. However, its reporting capabilities are outdated and insufficient for current operational needs. To compensate, the City Presentation team relies on a combination of the existing ESRI platform and Microsoft Excel to establish and monitor monthly and annual key performance indicators (KPIs) across precinct teams. This includes tracking metrics such as the total square meters serviced each month. Key limitations of the current system include: Inability to track the number of jobs completed or the volume of customer requests received (only those actioned are recorded). Lack of integration with rainfall data, which is instead managed through a separate sports field application. No functionality to map or incorporate new assets under development (e.g., roadside mowing sites, parks) that will be transferred to Council via developers. These constraints significantly hinder forward planning and resource allocation, particularly as the city continues to grow and new maintenance responsibilities emerge.",

This approach presents several challenges: Inefficiency and Resourcing: Manual inspections consume significant staff time and limit the frequency and coverage of the network that can be assessed, particularly following natural disasters when resources are already stretched. Data Gaps for DRFA Claims: Post-disaster damage assessments are time-sensitive and currently lack consistent, geo-tagged photographic records of road defects, making it harder to substantiate claims under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA). Lack of Real-Time Visibility: Without continuous data collection, defects can go undetected until they worsen or are reported by the public, which delays intervention and increases repair costs. Missed Opportunities for Proactive Maintenance: The current process limits our ability to identify early signs of deterioration and program works proactively, increasing long-term asset risks and reactive maintenance demands. These limitations are impacting our ability to maintain optimal service levels across the road network, particularly in the context of climate-related weather events and increasing community expectations.",

    "description": "Opportunity or problem: The Legal Team's core IT systems require updating to meet expectations of internal customers and Council’s ongoing business improvement efforts.The legal team’s main systems are: \t• Practice Evolve (2016): Practice Evolve (2016): File and document management/PE does some reporting + order company and property searches which is 3rd party plug in \"Infotrack\"<it is nice to have>/For external lawyer- file in PE as well / via email / Usually someone is helping from legal and updating the PE as it cant be accessed by external parties. In many cases the departments themselves interract with the external lawyers. They will put that in TRIM cant update PE / Law firms cant also update the file PE \t• Authority CRM (2017): Matter intake/ online form also but not much takers/ emails or calls > if it is received. .sent to group inbox daily standups >then open a file in PE and get a number.. Use that id for tracking and any comms.. \t• MS Forms (2021): Customer satisfaction \t• MS Excel (2020): Time tracking and reporting \t• MS Planner (2020): Task management-don’t use it planner any more. Manages task as they are allocated -non standard approach \t• DocuSign (2022): Digital signatures Challenges : Heavy reliance on email for task tracking: File management using Practice Evolve is heavily dependent on emails being appropriately filed. Ensuring filing is up to date can be time consuming, especially when it is not attended to consistently. The focus on email as the primary means of information exchange can lead to staff viewing their inbox as a de facto task list, which can impede use of the task management system, leading to it being out of date and hence less useful. Also, in large matters the sheer volume of emails can make it time consuming to find key documents and hard to obtain a quick overview of what the matter is about. Manual monthly reporting:Data from these systems is used to generate monthly reports that are the primary mechanism for sharing details of aggregate activity to individual departments, OLT and the Executive. The production of these reports is a manual process that requires a significant input from the Legal Team Administrator and individual team members. Individual matter level reporting is provided as needed to customers, primarily through email and/or direct conversations. This is a manual process that can be time consuming and is critically dependant on the input of the individual team members who are working on the matter concerned. The task management system is not granular enough to enable customers or management to obtain real time status updates without engaging directly with the person working on the matter. The use of a patchwork of multiple systems feels overly complex for a small team (8 people). This appears to be contributing to team frustrations with processes that are showing up in pulse surveys. Additionally, current systems are unable to support improvement initiatives that are being pursued by internal customers without significant and complex background development (eg: streamlining property transactions, improved contract management). How is the business need being met: There is currently no process in place to meet the business need • External contractors cant view /access PE<Nice to have>",
