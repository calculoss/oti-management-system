2. Create repository: `oti-management-system`
3. Make it **Private** (for internal council use)
4. Initialize with README
5. Clone to your machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/oti-management-system.git
   cd oti-management-system
   ```

### Step 2: Add Your Documents (2 minutes)

```bash
# Copy all 6 documents to your project folder
cp /path/to/OTI-Management-Requirements.md .

git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Setup GitHub Pages (3 minutes)

1. Create deployment workflow:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
   permissions:
     contents: read
     pages: write
     id-token: write
   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
         - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
           with:
             path: '.'
         - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
   ```

3. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
   - Save

4. Push:

   git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 4: Open in Cursor (2 minutes)

1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Open your project folder
3. Open TASKS.md (keep visible)
4. Start with this prompt:

```
I'm building an OTI Management System for Lake Macquarie City Council.

Please read these documents to understand the project:
1. OTI-Management-Requirements.md - Complete requirements
2. CURSOR-PROMPT.md - Technical specifications  
3. TASKS.md - Task breakdown

## 🎯 What This Solves

### The Problem
Your IT department's "Ideas" system became a **black hole**:
- ❌ No understanding of current state
- ❌ No universal view of the pipeline
- ❌ No visibility into bottlenecks
- ❌ No metrics to assess performance
- ❌ No accountability or progress tracking

### Your Solution
A transparent, metrics-driven OTI Management System that provides:
- ✅ **Clear visibility** - Dashboard shows pipeline health at a glance
- ✅ **Accountability** - Track ownership, progress, blockers
- ✅ **Performance insight** - Metrics show where you excel or struggle
- ✅ **Early warning** - Identify stalled OTIs before critical
- ✅ **Continuous improvement** - Trends show if processes improving
- ✅ **Live demo** - Share URL with workmates instantly!

---

## 🌐 Your Live Demo Setup

Once you complete Phase 1 (6-8 hours of development), you'll have:

**Live Demo URL**:
```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/oti-management-system/
```

**Share with workmates**:
- Simple URL to share
- Works on any device (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Updates automatically when you push changes
- No installation required for viewers

**Development workflow**:
```bash
# Morning: Get latest
git pull origin main

# Work on task in Cursor
# [Complete TASK-007]

# Save and deploy
git add .
git commit -m "TASK-007: OTI list view - Complete"
git push origin main

# 1-2 minutes later: Live site updated!
# Share with workmates: "Check out the new list view!"
```

## 👥 Demonstrating to Workmates

### Preparation (Before Demo)

**1. Ensure sample data is realistic**:
- Mix of statuses (Received, In Progress, Stalled, Done)
- Varied priorities (Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
- Different teams represented
- Some OTIs overdue (shows alerts)
- Date range spanning 6 months (for trends)

**2. Create demo script** (10 minutes total):
```
1. Dashboard (2 min): Show pipeline, metrics, trends
2. OTI List (2 min): Demo filtering, sorting, search
3. OTI Detail (2 min): Show full information, notes
4. Add OTI (2 min): Walk through form, auto-calculations
5. Q&A (2 min): Gather feedback
```

**3. Share the URL**:
```
Send email/Slack:

"Check out the OTI Management prototype:
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/oti-management-system/

This replaces the Ideas black hole with transparent pipeline management.
Would love your feedback!"
```

### During Demo

**DO**:
- ✅ Start with the problem: "Ideas became a black hole"
- ✅ Show the solution: "Now we have visibility"
- ✅ Be specific: "Here's how I'd find stalled items"
- ✅ Ask for feedback: "What would you add?"

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Apologize for incomplete features
- ❌ Get lost in technical details
- ❌ Focus on what's missing
- ❌ Oversell it as finished

### After Demo

**Collect feedback via GitHub Issues**:
```bash
# Create issue for each suggestion
GitHub → Issues → New Issue

Title: "Add PDF export to dashboard"
Description: "From demo: Users want monthly report exports"
Label: enhancement, feedback
```

**Update TASKS.md** with feedback notes:
```markdown
## Demo Feedback - [Date]

**What worked well**:
- Dashboard very clear
- Love the visual pipeline

**Suggestions**:
- Add PDF export
- Need date range filter
- Want email notifications

**Next steps**:
- Prioritize top 3
- Create GitHub issues
- Schedule follow-up demo
```
